HOW TO BUILD ZGB FACTORY SUITE

Currently the ZGB factory images are based from "factory-980.B" branch.
To build that:

1. Create a new directory for the factory branch. Please change the name to
   whatever you like:

    mkdir chromeos-factory-980 && cd chromeos-factory-980

2. Initialize a new checkout with the factory branch specified:

    repo init -m minilayout.xml -b factory-980.B \
              -u http://git.chromium.org/chromiumos/manifest.git

3. Copy the "local_manifest.xml" from factory bundle into .repo folder:

    cp PATH_TO_BUNDLE/local_manifest.xml .repo/local_manifest.xml

4. Check that your ssh key is being managed by your ssh agent:

    ssh-add -L

    If your key is not listed, do "ssh-add ~/.ssh/chromium" (change the path if
    needed to point to your private ssh key used for Chrome OS) If you get a
    "can't open a connection to your ssh agent" message, do "ssh-agent bash"
    then add your key.

5. Sync the code:

    repo sync

    You may try "repo sync -j 8" to sync faster.

6. Build choot environment (this is the same as any Chrome OS build):

    cros_sdk --download
    cros_sdk  # enter chroot

    (cros_sdk is a command in your depot_tools folder, or use
     chromite/bin/cros_sdk)

7. Build ChromiumOS (factory) images (same as ChromeOS build):

    (in chroot) cd ~/trunk/src/scripts
    ./set_shared_user_password.sh  # only need to do this one time
    ./setup_board --board=x86-zgb --default
    ./build_packages --noenabledebug
    ./build_image --noenable_rootfs_verification --factory

    Your factory test image will be located in
    ../build/images/x86-zgb/latest/chromiumos_factory_image.bin
